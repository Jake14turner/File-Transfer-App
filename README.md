# File-Transfer-App
Small app that will transfer files between 2 computers over the cloud. Written in python
Utalizes sockets for the online connectivity as well as tkinter for the UI. This was my first time experimenting how to work with files, as well as connect with other computers; i learned different protocols, http requests, and many other things that are very interesting.
